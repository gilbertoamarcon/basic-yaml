# Basic Yaml Usage

This code shows usage example of YAML to 'stringfy' and 'de-stringfy' a python dictionary into a YAML format string (without actually storing it to a file).

The YAML string can be send over the network for the user interface to 'de-stringfy' and recover the original dictionary. 


To run the code:
```
python main.py
```
